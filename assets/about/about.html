    <h1>Help Page</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! This is the about page for my IMSA schedule/map site.
        The backend for this site is written in Rust. It is hosted with shuttle.rs.
        The frontend is only javascript used to generate the lines.
        The inspiration for this idea came from the IMSA code society's
        original basic path finder, where you input two places and it generates
        a path between the two. This project builds on that basic idea by having one
        input their schedule and have the path be auto-generated.

        The current changes to the code were made by me. My github for this project
        is <a href="https://github.com/1337isnot1337/ClassroomFinder-rust"> here.</a> The github for the
        IMSA code society's original work is <a href="https://github.com/IMSA-Code-Society/ClassroomFinder">here</a>.

        Simply copy and paste the area shown in the image into the schedule text
        box and press enter! You can find this by going to your IMSA PowerSchool,
        scrolling down to the bottom left, and clicking on the "Year Schedule". 
        Make sure you copy in both your first and second semester.

    <p style="font-size: smaller;">I know a lot of the labels have 
        gibberish, I will update all the labels once I get a better map.</p>
