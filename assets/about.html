        Hello! This is the about page for my IMSA schedule/map site.
        The backend for this site is written in Rust. It is hosted with shuttle.rs.
        The frontend is only javascript used to generate the lines.
        The inspiration for this idea came from the IMSA code society's
        original basic path finder, where you input two places and it generates
        a path between the two. This project builds on that basic idea by having one
        input their schedule and have the path be auto-generated.

        The current changes to the code were made by me. My github for this project
        is <a href="https://github.com/1337isnot1337/ClassroomFinder-rust"> here.</a> The github for the
        IMSA code society's original work is <a href="https://github.com/IMSA-Code-Society/ClassroomFinder">here</a>.
